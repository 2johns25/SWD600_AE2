# Introduction

### Background

Maintaining a consistent website can be difficult for large organisations, where multiple web designers and developers will come along and add their own pieces of code over a long period of time. To help combat this problem, a pattern library can be adopted which helps to maintain consistency across a website [Boag, 2017](https://boagworld.com/design/pattern-library/).

### Aim

The aim of this project is to create a simple pattern library which will include, what's considered the very essential UI components of any pattern library, plus extra, and produce a small website to to document those UI components, which can be downloaded and used by other web designers and developers.

### Pattern libraries

According to [Lazier (2015)](https://trydesignlab.com/blog/pattern-libraries-what-they-are-and-why-you-need-o/), not every project necessarily needs to start from nothing, and sometimes requires a tried and tested solution, to ensure that a website is consistenct and robust. This is the purpose of a pattern library.

Pattern libraries are a collection of UI elements in the form of HTML snippets, which can be used across multiple projects, over and over again. [(Rutherford, 2017)](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/design-systems-vs-pattern-libraries-vs-style-guides-whats-difference/). Accroding to Rutherford, the term pattern library is often used interchangable, but they are actually different things entierly. A design system is a combination of a pattern libary and styleguide as well as rules and standards, to ensure that they are used properly.

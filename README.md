# Introduction

Pattern libraries are an essential part of a web developers toolkit, enabling them to quickly put together an interface with consistency and precision. 

[simplePattern]( https://2johns25.github.io/SWD600_AE2/index.html) is a basic, lightweight, responsive pattern library, featuring key UI elements often found in other popular libraries such as Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton and Simple Grid.

This Github repository contains the source code for the simplePattern documentation website, along with the downloadable CSS and JavaScript files for the simplePattern library.
